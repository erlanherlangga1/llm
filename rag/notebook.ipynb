In traditional farming, cultivation was\\nmanual process irrigational needs of a crop and its yield was highly dependent on\\nclimate factors throughout the globe. The onset of inventions in industrial revolu-\\ntion and improvement in mechanisms involved in agricultural practices gave relief\\nto miserable life of farmers. But still, it is a labor-intensive practice and dependent\\non mercy of monsoon.\\nThus, there is a need of developing a system that automates the agricultural prac-\\ntices such as cultivation and irrigation, predicts yields, and help in better planning for\\nsystematizing the demand and supply of agricultural products throughout the globe.\\nA blend of AI and IoT technologies intelligently gathers relevant information about\\ndifferent crops, their growth rate, and irrigation requirements. These technologies\\nare effective in monitoring frequent climate change, weather forecasting, nutrition\\ndeﬁciency in plants, plants’ health monitoring, pest control, weed management, etc.\\nResearchers have covered a long way in developing subsidiary technology such as\\ngeo-positioning satellites (GPS), satellite imagery and sensors for monitoring of\\nyield affecting parameters such as moisture, soil pH level, temperature, etc. Target\\nexperimentation at various stages of cultivation such as water resource management,\\nweed elimination, diseases prediction, pest control, estimation of yield production\\nand effective storage of agricultural products is still starving. These challenges can\\nbe addressed by applying the techniques of AI and data science.\\nA voluminous data about agriculture is collected using various sensors such as\\nremote sensors, proximity sensors, temperature/humidity sensors, etc. Advanced\\nInternet facilities disseminate this data to various channels such as the cloud. The\\nintroduction of online data storage at cloud, advancements in techniques of data\\nprocessing, and increase in computation power become effective in dealing with\\nchallenges identiﬁed in agriculture. Use of advanced techniques makes agricultural\\npredictions more precise, reliable, and useful.\\n1.1 Scope of AI in Agriculture\\nTraditional agricultural practices used by farmers are not adequate to fulﬁll the\\nincreasing demand. To serve this increasing demand, farmers need to adopt the latest\\nadvancements in agriculture such as use of state-of-the-art tools/machinery and AI-\\nbased techniques. It has been observed that most of the farmers are unaware of uses\\nof pesticides speciﬁcally in what amount and when. Due to these practices, fertility\\nof the soil, as well as yield production, degrades in an intensiﬁed way. A plethora\\nof researchers has proved the increased gain in yield growth with the help of AI and\\nautomation. AI can contribute to agriculture in versatile ways. Authors explain the\\ninclusion of AI in the following seven agricultural practices.', metadata={'source': 'jurnal.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AI-Based Yield Prediction and Smart Irrigation 157\\n1.1.1 Weather Forecasting\\nOne of the important advantages of AI in agriculture is weather forecasting. With the\\nhelp of latest AI-based state-of-the-art weather forecasting techniques, it becomes\\neasier for farmers to take appropriate decisions in planning respective crops. Nowa-\\ndays, many weather forecasting devices are available for predicting the weather.\\nSehgal et al. [1] presented a visual tool ( ViSeed) based on long short-term memory\\n(LSTM) [2] which can be used for weather and soil predictions. With the help of such\\nfarmer-friendly tools, one can plan his/her crop activities, crop types in an efﬁcient\\nway.\\n1.1.2 Smart Irrigation\\nTo cope with the shortage of water, there is a critical need for some smart irrigation\\nsystems that can irrigate more areas with low consumption of water. A comprehensive\\nreview of various techniques of smart irrigation has been presented in Jha et al. [ 3].\\nHowever, there is an availability of various low water consumption-based irrigation\\ntechniques, for example, sprinkler systems and drip irrigation systems; but these\\nsystems need human intervention up to a great extent. There is a scope to add features\\nto existing systems to develop smart irrigation systems. The system continuously\\nmonitors the level of water in a crop, compares the water content available in soil\\nand crop plant with standard need of water. It automatically starts sprinklers or drips\\nas per water requirements of crop. Arif et al. [4] presented ANN-based models for\\npredicting soil moistures.\\nA Neural Network-based irrigation system (Neuro-Drip) has been presented by\\nHinnell et al. [ 5]. On the other hand, an IoT-based smart irrigation management\\nsystem has been presented by Goap et al. [ 6], Nawandar and Satpute [ 7]. AI in this\\nﬁeld has contributed a lot in collaboration with the Internet of Things (IoT). For smart\\nirrigation, there is a requirement of gathering of information about level of moisture\\npresent in the soil, water content in plants, humidity in atmosphere, temperature, etc.\\nThis information can be gathered using soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors,\\nhumidity monitoring sensors, etc. These sensors are connected to low price Arduino-\\nbased systems for storage of gathered information and executing analysis algorithms\\nfor predicting the water requirement of crop at a particular time.\\n1.1.3 Crop Disease Prediction and Health Monitoring\\nTraditional methods of monitoring crop health are time-consuming and inefﬁcient\\nespecially for larger areas of thousands of acres. Many researchers have developed\\nmany AI-based architectures to overcome the challenges identiﬁed in the arena of\\ntraditional agriculture. Some architectures are surveyed in Kamilaris and Prenafeta-\\nBoldú [8].', metadata={'source': 'jurnal.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Sinwar et al.\\nAI-based techniques with inclusion of image processing, deep learning, and data\\nanalysis provide an easy and effective way for disease prediction and health moni-\\ntoring. The system captures crop images using high deﬁnition(HD) camera-enabled\\ndrones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UA Vs), or satellite imagery. The captured images\\nare used as dataset for training of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) [ 9], a class\\nof Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN). CNNs extract useful features from fed images\\nand make predictions about disease(s) in crops. The system is effective in continuous\\nmonitoring of health of plants and hence gives better solutions for calculating amount\\nof pesticides to be used and time to use a pesticide.\\n1.1.4 Crop Readiness Identiﬁcation\\nAI-based system captures images of a crop and analyzes them for determining the\\ncrop readiness in a particular area for harvesting. The crops can be categorized into\\ndifferent categories on the basis of readiness and other quality parameters before\\nactually sending them to market. For categorization, use of various pattern clustering\\ntechniques viz. K-means, fuzzy C-means (FCM), expectation maximization (EM),\\nand hierarchical clustering plays an important role.\\n1.1.5 Yield Prediction\\nYield prediction is an area of interest for researchers for past many decades. Yield\\nprediction requires yield mapping devices, which are still not easily available to\\nfarmers [ 10]. CNNs can solve the problem of yield prediction in an economic and\\neasy way. Many researchers [ 10–12] have developed models to predict crop yields\\nusing AI-based methods which use RGB/normalized difference vegetation index\\n(NDVI) images. Their experimental results on publically available dataset prove the\\nusefulness of their models. A comparative analysis of CNN-based models with AI-\\nbased models clearly indicates that CNNs are more advantageous than traditional\\nMachine Learning (ML) and AI-based techniques [ 13]. Authors will discuss the\\ndetailed process of predicting crop yields using CNN in Sect. 2.\\n1.1.6 Weed/Pest Management\\nTraditionally, weed management was accomplished with a combination of many\\ntechniques viz. mechanical weed control, crop rotation, herbicides, etc. [ 14]. In\\naddition to the above, various biochemical-based combined weed and pest control\\nsolutions are also available in the market, but they all results in reducing the yield\\nproductivity. The reduction in crop yield occurs due to the spraying of pesticides\\nfrequently and in a constant amount in a ﬁeld. AI provides an intelligent solution for\\nthis challenge.', metadata={'source': 'jurnal.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AI-Based Yield Prediction and Smart Irrigation 159\\nRecently, one AI-based autonomous robot called “ Agbots” has been developed by\\nMcAllister et al. [ 14], which can do weed management in the ﬁeld in an interesting\\nmanner. The idea behind AI-based weed management is to identify weeds automati-\\ncally (by examining camera images obtained from autonomous robots) and perform\\ncorrective actions (mechanically weed removal or spraying herbicides) accordingly.\\nMany other AI-based techniques are also available such as See and Spray (by Blue\\nRiver Technologies [15]), which uses AI to identify and spray individual plants in\\nmilliseconds.\\n1.1.7 Precision Farming/Agriculture\\nThe aim of precision agriculture (PA) is to increase yield production as well as quality\\nby simultaneously reducing the overall cost and environmental pollution [ 16]. The\\nquantity and quality of a crop depend on many parameters such as soil, weather,\\nirrigation, etc. So, there is a requirement to monitor all these parameters at a regular\\ninterval of time. Traditional monitoring techniques are not adequate in accurate and\\nefﬁcient monitoring of these parameters.\\nSo, there is vital demand for an automated system which can perform monitoring\\nof parameters in an effective way. In modern era, proximity sensing and remote sens-\\ning dominate the ﬁeld of agriculture and effectively monitor a plethora of parameters\\nrequired for better prediction and planning of agricultural practices. Proximity sens-\\ning speciﬁcally deals with soil using high-resolution data. Remote sensing provides\\nthe geographical sensing of ﬁelds using various sensors. Thermal remote sensing\\nprovides some additional information such as temperature, water status, etc. It also\\nhelps us in getting many vegetation indices. Many researchers attempted to present\\nseveral vegetation indices on the basis of various parameters. Xue and Su [17]p r e -\\nsented a systematic reviewed of many vegetation indices. AI in collaboration with\\nthese techniques can provide cost-effective solutions for PA.\\n2 Yield Prediction\\nManual record-keeping and monitoring trends in agricultural activities and yields\\nare a tedious and time-consuming task. There are fair chances that farmers are not\\navailable all the time to keep track of all agricultural activities. Thus, it results in\\ncollection of incomplete and inconsistent data. AI-based solutions are effective to\\novercome such situations. In the era of technology, this is mandatory to motivate\\nand train farmers for adoption of new tools and techniques. This is highly desirable\\nto reduce the manual efforts, improve quality of crops, and to meet the increasing\\ndemand of food for increasing population.\\nPrecision agriculture provides an intelligent solution to the challenges observed in\\nthe ﬁeld of traditional agriculture.

The planning\\nof timeline for agricultural activities on the basis of past experience and collected\\nrecord is demonstrated in Nevavuori et al. [ 10].\\nFarmers are preparing timeline and maintaining record of following parameters\\nfor better prediction.\\n• Soil fertility and improving fertility by using manures, compost, organic and inor-\\nganic fertilizers, bio-fertilizers, etc.\\n• Growth rate of a crop.\\n• Irrigation requirements in terms of amount of water required and time and fre-\\nquency of irrigation.\\n• Determining precise amount of pesticide and time of spraying pesticide.\\n• Identifying type(s) of weed growing with a particular crop, growth rate of weed\\nand determining methods to destroy weed plants without harming the main crop.\\n• Season wise and crop-wise yield estimation.\\n• Summarizing timeline for future, based on accumulated knowledge and experi-\\nence.\\n2.1 Machine Learning T echniques for Yield Prediction\\nReview of related literature reveals the existence of a signiﬁcant research work in\\nthe ﬁeld of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for agriculture. The categories of\\nresearch work are speciﬁcally in yield prediction, disease prediction, crop quality\\nprediction, yield estimation, price estimation and weed detection and eradication. In\\nthis section, authors give a brief summary of existing works in the domain of yield\\nprediction using ML-based techniques.\\nLiakos et al. [ 18] demonstrate different ML models used for solving real-\\nworld problems. Most commonly used ML models are Artiﬁcial Neural Networks\\n(ANNs) Deep Learning (DL), Support V ector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT),\\nBayesian Models (BM), Ensemble Learning (EL), and Dimensionality Reduction\\n(DR). There are numerous ML techniques available based on these ML models.\\nThese models are based on one or more ML techniques namely Convolution Neu-\\nral Networks (CNNs), BackpPropagation Network (BPN), Feedforward Network\\n(FFN), Hopﬁeld Network (HN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function\\nNetwork (RBF), Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), Deep Neural Networks (DNN),\\nK-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Multiple Linear\\nRegression (MLR), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and Ensemble Neural\\nNetworks (ENN).\\nThe process of yield prediction using Machine Learning starts with capturing\\nimages of crop.

The retraining continues until the model\\nbecomes capable of making precise predictions of yields. Figure1 demonstrates the\\narchitecture of yield prediction using ML.\\nLet us look at some of the research works carried out by researchers in the ﬁeld\\nof crop yield prediction using ML techniques.\\nWang et al. [ 19] developed a computer vision-based system which can automat-\\nically estimate the number of apples in an apple orchard. The system is accurate\\nas well as faster in nature. This system contains a vehicle for moving in the ﬁeld.\\nThe vehicle dismounted with high precision cameras on metal frames. Both vehicle\\nand cameras are calibrated accurately according to coordinate frames. Apple regions\\nare identiﬁed with the help of pixel properties. Their model used hue, saturation,\\nand value for identiﬁcation of specular reﬂections. Experimental results and analysis\\nshow that their model is able to calculate the number of apples accurately and rapidly.\\nRamos et al. [ 20] proposed a method for counting the coffee fruits. Their machine\\nvision system (MVS) is capable of counting and classifying coffee fruit. Harvestable\\nand non-harvestable fruits were categorized in this work. They captured images\\nvia a mobile-based system and processed the images using linear estimation model\\nto calculate the number of coffee fruits on a branch. MVS has ﬁve stages as: (i)\\nacquisition, (ii) segmentation, (iii) fruit boundary/outline detection, (iv) adjustment\\nof ellipses, and (v) detection, classiﬁcation, and counting of fruits.

They have used unmanned ariel vehi-\\ncles (UA Vs) for obtaining high-resolution RGB images. For categorizing pixels into\\ntwo categories as “tomatoes” and “non-tomatoes,” spectral clustering is used using\\nK-means, self-organizing maps (SOM), and expectation maximization (EM). Mor-\\nphological operations are used for segmentation. Their experimental results showed\\nthat the performance of EM was found better than K-means and SOM in the counting\\nof tomatoes.\\nPantazi et al.

As we know that to predict the crop yield, there is a\\nneed for various parameters. In this system, researchers have used one such parameter\\ncalled normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), mentioned as follows:\\nNDVI = (NIR − R)/(NIR + R) (1)\\nwhere NIR is near-infrared and R is red bands, which enables the accurate estimation\\nof yield per area. On the other hand, to measure the soil properties, they have used\\nvis-NIR spectrophotometers. Experimental results consisting of ﬁeld maps show\\nthat the performance of SKNs was found best among three SOM-based models in\\npredicting wheat yield crop.\\nAmatya et al. [ 22] developed a machine vision-based system for automatic har-\\nvesting of Cherry fruits because manual harvesting is very labor exhaustive which\\ncauses more than 50% of production cost. A Bayesian classiﬁer is used to classify the\\ndetected branches, leaves, cherry, and background. After getting information about\\nbranches and cherry, we can harvest them accordingly. The system is capable of\\ndetecting branches with an accuracy of nearly 90%.\\nSengupta and Lee [ 23] presented an SVM-based model for detection of immature\\ngreen Citrus fruit in varying lighting conditions. The system is able to detect nearly\\n80% of citrus fruits in the tree canopy. In addition to the above, lots more work in the\\narea of yield prediction is available. Liakos et al.

They have classiﬁed these\\ntechniques into different categories such as yield prediction, disease detection, weed\\nmonitoring, etc.\\n2.2 Remote Sensing-Based Yield Prediction\\nRemote sensing brings information about a ﬁeld, crops, or an object without actually\\nvisiting the ﬁeld.

It comprises of\\nfour basic steps viz. data capturing, data interpretation, information production, and\\ndecision making.\\n2.2.1 Data Capturing\\nThe process of capturing data is done in either of two ways, i.e., active or passive. In\\nthe case of active remote sensing, sensors are focusing directly on objects and send\\nthe sensed information to the control station which is located on the ground. Active\\nsensors make uses of their own energy sources for object illumination.\\nPassive remote sensing follows the concept of reﬂection.

This process is\\nintended also for ﬁltering of only relevant data which needs to be considered for the\\nnext phases. V arious mathematical/statistical techniques are being applied in order\\nto get the required information.\\n2.2.3 Information Production\\nThe next step after interpreting data is the production of the required information. As\\nwe know that the processed data can be presented in the form of various visual rep-\\nresentations such as graphs, charts, maps, GIS data, etc. We can get various types of\\ninformation with the help of remote sensing data such as yield modeling/forecasting,\\nnutrient deﬁciency graphs, area estimation, soil mapping, etc. These graphs/charts\\nare the best way to represent the gathered information, by which we can take effective\\nand timely decisions.\\n2.2.4 Decision Making\\nWith the help of various visual representations, one can take effective decisions. The\\nobjective of these decisions is very clear: maximizing the net proﬁt by increasing the\\nquality as well as quantity of the crop. Also, there is a need to identify risk factors in\\nachieving this objective. Nowadays, the process of decision making becomes easier\\nwith the help of various AI-based techniques. Once we have obtained the required\\ninformation, we can present this information to the information scientists in order\\nto save them in the knowledge base. On the basis of certain parameters AI/Machine\\nLearning (ML) systems are able to predict/provide efﬁcient decisions (such as the\\nnecessity of water treatment, moisture prediction, irrigation requirements, pesticide\\nrequirements, etc.) which makes farmers away from critical thinking process and\\nobtaining maximum proﬁts out of minimum/required efforts. Traditional ML tech-\\nniques use feature extraction in the earlier stages, and on the basis of these features,\\ndifferent tasks (crop classiﬁcation, yield prediction, etc.) were carried out [ 10]. But\\ntraditional ML techniques were not sufﬁcient in producing the optimal decisions.\\nNowadays, it becomes possible to provide optimal decisions with the help of some\\nadvanced paradigms such as Deep Learning paradigm. Among various Deep Learn-\\ning paradigms, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) prove to be efﬁcient in image\\nanalysis/classiﬁcation. By combing Remote Sensing with Deep Learning techniques,\\nwe can have effective agricultural decisions that can maximize the farmer’s proﬁt.\\n2.3 Big Data-Based Yield Prediction\\nWith the advancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), mas-\\nsive volumes of data are being generated.

As mentioned above in the ﬁrst\\nstep, we may require the capturing of data from multiple sources. If data is gathered\\nfrom multiple sources, deﬁnitely it will not be in a uniform shape. It is the task of\\ndata analysts to prepare and arrange data in a uniform shape which in future can be\\ntransferred/transformed.\\nThere are numerous data analysis techniques [ 26] available, but for analyzing\\nagricultural data, we have to focus on some speciﬁc techniques such as scalable\\nvector machines, K-means, NDVI, Wavelet/Fourier transformations, etc. In addi-\\ntion, to predict the crop yield, big data can do more with agricultural data such as\\nweather forecasting, soil/land analysis, food availability, etc. In this regard, Kamilaris\\net al.[26] presented a systematic yet remarkable review of various big data techniques\\nfor agriculture.\\n3 Smart Irrigation Systems\\nEfﬁcient utilization of water is a challenging task especially for places where avail-\\nability of water is a major concern. For gaining high yields, one has to irrigate the\\nﬁeld when needed or we can say that the exact amount and time of irrigation must\\nbe known. Nowadays with the help of new innovations in technology, we are liv-\\ning in the world of advanced irrigation systems called “smart irrigation.” The word\\nsmart means, the sensors are able to sense the water requirements in plants. This\\nability is achieved by combining multiple technologies viz. automation, sensors,\\nand knowledge (AI). Even though these systems are not costly in nature, due to\\nlack of awareness, most of the farmers are adopting a traditional way of irrigation\\nwhich results in inefﬁcient utilization of water and low crop yield.

Sinwar et al.\\nFig. 15 Crop growth after\\ninstallation of IoT-based\\nlow-cost smart irrigation\\nsystem [ 7]\\n3.2 Architecture of Proposed Smart Irrigation\\nSystems/Automated Irrigation Infrastructure\\nAs discussed in the previous section, various smart irrigation systems have been\\nproposed by many researchers which are overcoming the drawbacks of traditional\\nirrigation systems (drip irrigation, direct pump/canal irrigation, sprinkler irrigation,\\ntube well irrigation) that need continuous monitoring of ﬁeld. Most of these smart\\nirrigation systems are capable of automated irrigation of crop ﬁeld on the basis of sen-\\nsor values. Sensor nodes are the most essential part of these systems. Other important\\ncomponents include but not limited to: controller unit, wireless medium, GSM mod-\\nule, Arduino, display unit, relay, Raspberry Pi, water pump, sprinklers/drip modules,\\netc. The difference in these systems arises due to two things, viz. variety/capability of\\nsensor nodes and their organization with other components. Temperature sensors are\\nresponsible for observing the amount of temperature adequate for a particular crop,\\nwhereas moisture sensors are capable of sensing level of moisture in soil. It is the\\nresponsibility of system designer to obtain the values from these sensors continuously\\nor at some speciﬁed intervals. Some systems were found to be energy efﬁcient in\\nthe sense that wireless nodes must not sense and send the information continuously;\\nrather, they were calibrated to do these tasks at user-speciﬁed interval thresholds.\\nA controlled unit is continuously observing these sensed values and enables water\\npump operations (On and Off). The positioning of sprinklers/drip modules should\\nbe mounted speciﬁcally according to the plant/crop and land structure. There is no\\ngeneral irrigation system available which can satisfy the irrigation requirement of\\nall types of crops/ﬁelds, because the structure and irrigation needs are not same for\\nall crops. Considering these versatilities in the ﬁeld/crop, intelligent irrigation sys-\\ntems should be capable of making decisions on real-time sensed values as well as', metadata={'source': 'jurnal.pdf', 'page': 22})]"
